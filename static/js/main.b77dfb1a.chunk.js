We visited Lion\u2019s point, from where we could see the mighty Sahyadri standing tall, all in its glory. Although, the weather was hot, the cool breeze gushing around help us stay refreshed.

The idol is about 54 feet tall mounted on a hill, hence visible from kilometers away. The stunning backdrop of a starry sky added more charm to it.

After every few minutes\u2019 walk around the fort, you will get to see a few local shopkeepers selling traditional Maharashtrian lunch. You can choose from a wide variety of options. Being an ardent food lover, I chose to try all of the items. I had the Vangyacha Bhareet (roasted brinjal curry), different types of chutneys and thecha (chilly chutney), peethla, jhunka-bhakar and taak (spicy buttermilk). The cherry on the cake is that in addition to this tasty feast, each shopkeeper will provide you with a mat and shed under a canopy of bushes to sit and have your food. You can spend as much time as you want under the canopy, and trust me, it\u2019s way better than the luxurious 5-star restaurants have to offer. Soon, it was time to leave the fortress on our way back home."},{image:Ca.a,desc:"This short, unplanned and beautiful trip helped me get refreshed from all the stress I had before.

So basically, sleep and food-deprived, hurriedly packing bags, I somehow managed to board the bus. The bus journey was tiresome, being students, we are always low on budget and we have to compromise on our comfort sometimes, so cutting costs on food and traveling is often the most viable option. We left for NYC at night and by the time we reached there, it was dawn. Seeing the sunrise as we passed by the city, painted a beautiful picture of it which, will always be fed into my mind. "},{image:Wa.a,desc:"I was truly grateful to have got a comfortable stay in Jersey City, thanks to my friend.

So, living in NJ took care of my food, accommodation and saved money on travel. Being a student, it is necessary to cut the costs wherever required. This trip taught me to do so"},{image:Ya.a,desc:"NYC is one of the most expensive cities not only to live in but also to travel to. First and the foremost thing to do is to get the metro card and NJ transit app. Metro and buses are the cheapest yet fastest way to stroll in and around the city. Luckily, having so many days with me to explore NYC I had a chance to visit the city from my place several times. First, I went with my friend, which helped me learn how to use public transportation. The best part of being a student is, you will somehow find the cheapest of everything, food, transport, sightseeing. In addition to this, the government also has provided various discounts and provisions for a student, so we took advantage of it and tried to see as many places as we could."},{image:Ga.a,desc:"A few days later, after getting well acquainted with the transportation and places to explore around, I planned out an entire day to roam around the city. We had decided to explore downtown for a day. So, we started with going to Liberty State Park in NJ. From Jersey City, we took a cab to Liberty State Park. The only mistake we did that we didn't give a proper destination for the ride, hence we had to walk almost for 4 km into the park to get to the ferry. However, the walk turned out to be the best as we could be able to see Manhattan\u2019s skyline along with the Statue of Liberty. So, after walking for about 50 mins, we boarded the ferry for Manhattan. "},{image:Ha.a,desc:"From Liberty State Park we had an option to either go to the Statue of Liberty or to take the ferry directly for Manhattan which costs around 7$ per person, we opted for the latter option. We got off near the Brookfield center which had a beautiful lighting setup for Christmas. Then we proceeded towards the 9/11 memorial which is across the street of Brookfield center. Later, we boarded the metro to Brooklyn. Since we didn\u2019t want to miss the experience of \u2018walking\u2019 on the Brooklyn bridge and, wanted to save time, we opted to get a metro to Brooklyn instead and then come back to Manhattan to go the see Grand central station. "},{image:Ja.a,desc:"Once we reached Grand Central, we explored the historic station, I was amazed to see how well they have preserved the old ticket counters even today. Later, we walked towards Times Square. Although this was my third visit to Times Square, it had never failed to surprise me because every time there was something new happening. One major problem we had faced during the entire trip was food. Finding good and cheap food is a tedious task in NYC. We either have to opt for food trucks that will have reasonable rates but the taste may not be authentic enough to fulfill your expectations. Other options are restaurants that were too costly. One very common and famous things to have is NY pizzas. We decided to have biryani from one of the food trucks. The overall day was jam-packed with all the sightseeing of downtown Manhattan. We had walked almost 10-12 km exploring the city, an exhausting yet amusing day."},{image:Va.a,desc:"The next day, we planned to see Central Park and the Guggenheim Museum. I left at around 3 pm from Jersey City. Traveling alone in NYC had been in my bucket list, and this day I got to do so. It was both scary and exciting at the same time. I enjoyed figuring out buses and metro routes and hoping on them all alone. On the way, I met many types of people. I got down at the desired station and was waiting for my friend near the entrance for central park. At that time honestly, I was scared of going into the park as it was dark and there were very few pedestrians inside. But I had to pass through the park because the museum was across it. So anxiously, I started proceeding towards it. The paths and sidewalks were almost empty. I could see a few joggers and students roaming around though. So, I decided to stay on the main road which goes along the park. I had lost my track midway, both Google and Apple maps had given up. Luckily, I found a couple passing nearby and asked them the way to the museum. They were really helpful and made sure I am safe. It was a pleasure to meet them and have a short conversation on the way along. As directed by them I somehow reached the museum. "},{image:Ka.a,desc:"We had decided to visit the Guggenheim museum that day, as it was \u2018pay what you wish\u2019. Yes! One more chance to save a big number of bucks is to keep a track of the days when museums are open with \u2018pay what you wish\u2019 a hack to cut costs. Also, there are many museums which will just provide discounts for students who show up their identity cards whether you are a student of the USA or not, which I feel is quite awesome. There are so many world heritages here in the USA. One of them is the Guggenheim museum. It is an UNESCO work heritage site, one of the many located all around the world. The museum in NYC has a unique architecture with a white theme that seemed like an anthill to me. One thing I learned is that even if you are not into art, even if it makes you sleepy or something like that, just have an experience, find a painting that you like, read through its description and observe\u2026 take as much time as you wish, it\u2019s okay even if you aren't able to see every exhibit, but you must understand at least one of them. I feel lucky the I had a privilege to see great works from great artists all around the world here at Guggenheim.  "},{image:$a.a,desc:"One of the best things about NYC is its connectivity within and around the city which makes it easily commutable even for a stranger. Thanks to smartphones this magnanimous task has become much simpler and more efficient. Whenever I had to go, I just searched for the destination on the maps and got different routes to commute. Commuting through the metro in NYC is quite a task for first-timers but, you will get used to it within two or three trips easily. Similarly understanding the roads and lanes is somewhat confusing because like other cities, you don't have names for the street rather you have street and lane numbers. Having lived in India for so many years, I am used to getting familiar with the roads with names. It easy to understand and remember, so designating a street by number in NYC was tiresome and irritating initially but later when I commuted once or twice, I found out that this system is much better organized and precise."},{image:Za.a,desc:"Concluding this blog, I would say the NYC definitely gave an unforgettable experience and the most amazing thing I liked about it is the people. The people here are so polite. Being a young girl roaming around alone in an unknown city is honestly not easy. You have no idea what lies further. Also, commutting to a city like NYC you have high chances of getting lost in those narrow streets. The best and safest way to hang around here is to ask. Don't hesitate to ask the locals any questions you have. Even the stupidest of your queries won\u2019t ever be judged here and you will get help from them. People in NYC and the USA are welcoming and often make sure they will help you out in whatever possible way.
